# Machine Learning Based Predictive Alerts for Proactive System Failures Prevention

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to proactively predict and prevent system failures in middleware systems by analyzing historical system metrics.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict system anomalies and restarts proactively.
- Provide actionable alerts based on predictive insights.

## 📚 Structure
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory and analytical Jupyter notebooks.
- `models/`: Saved models (TensorFlow/Keras).
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for preprocessing, training, and prediction.
- `docs/`: Documentation and project report.
- `visuals/`: Generated figures and charts.
